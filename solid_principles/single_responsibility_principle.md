The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change, or in other words, it should have only one responsibility.

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) means that each class should have one specific job to do, like a person who has one clear task to focus on, so that the code is easier to understand and doesn't get confused with too many things happening at once.

Backpack, MusicPlayer, and Phone. Each class has a distinct responsibility:
1. The 'Backpack' class is responsible for storing items in the backpack. It has methods to add items and retrieve the items stored in the backpack.
2. The 'MusicPlayer' class is responsible for playing music. It has a method to play a specific song.
3. The 'Phone' class is responsible for making phone calls. It has a method to make a call to a specific number.

By separating the responsibilities into different classes, each class has a clear and single
responsibility. The 'Backpack' class focuses on managing items, the 'MusicPlayer' class 
focuses on playing music, and the 'Phone' class focuses on making phone calls. Following
the SRP makes the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.
