Open for extension but closed for modification.

Reduces the risk of introducing bugs through modifications, and promotes code reuse

In simpler terms, the OCP suggests that once a module or class is implemented, it should be easily extendable to add new functionality without modifying its existing code. This means that new features or behaviors can be added by extending the module or class rather than modifying its existing codebase.
